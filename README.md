## Association rules visualisation with Python
 Python-arulesviz is an attempt to port an incredible R's library[arulesviz](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arulesViz/vignettes/arulesViz.pdf). If familiar with R I would highly recommend to try it.

Python-arulesviz works as a jupyter-notebook widget:


## Install:
``` bash
pip install arulesviz
```
